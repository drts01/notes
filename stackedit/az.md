## Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

## Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

## Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

## Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

## Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

Identify candidates to train in Python.

Provided opportunity for customer support staff to expand their role and skill set by teaching them how to do post new products on the website.

## Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Proper implementation of secret propagation. I was not satisfied with the proposed solution. Across the next few days I researched and desiged a solution that was more secure and 

## Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Compliance enforcement

## Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

Cleaning up unused resources across all accounts.

## Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

Converting data entry systems from EOL Windows and MS Office machines to running open source software that was receiving security updates.

## Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Putting myself out there by doing demo/presentations for the team when I was new. This encouraged more junior engineers to try. I provided accolades during our weekly retrospectives for the effort made and information shared.

## Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Working with sysadmins to better understand their needs.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Advocating for a colleague to be promoted and move to automation team. I disagreed with the assessment that the team the engineer was could not afford to lose him. I felt it was unfair to engineer and that the company was risking loosing him all together. The next quarter he was the first promotion to a newly formed engineering team.

Disagreed with the design decision of secret propagation. While is was an improvement, it involved moving private keys and that did not sit well with me. I was the minority opinion so work began on the less than idea solution. Over the next few days I researched and designed an improved solution. I reached outed to a couple engineers for peer review and, in the process, gained their support. Then I presented the solution the team as a whole, illustrating a roadmap that would leverage the work that was in flight and a timeline that did not change our delivery date.

## Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
