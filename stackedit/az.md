## Customer Obsession

> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

* **Situation**: Many unused and old AWS resources, which was exacerbated from having term based contractors frequently rotating out.
* **Task**: As an engineer in operations, my customers were the service teams.
* **Action**:  Designed and implemented Policy-As-Code service for compliance enforcement.
	* MVP: Queried accounts to find resources I believed could be removed.
	* Identified early adopters, that would be open to test purging resources.
	* To gain buy-in/trust, I shared the report with the engineers and would only make the changes they approved.
	* To gain further trust/buy-in, shared report with wider org. Also, early adopters became advocates after seeing the impact to the AWS bill.
	*  Collaborated with account owners to identify their needs/requirements. Introduced security checks that would meet minimum resistance.
	* Gain more customers by reaching out to SecEng to demonstrate how they can approve and deny policy exceptions through git.
* **Result**: (Improved UX) Simplified management of the infrastructure, which customers did not know they needed.
	* Value: Lowered cost and improved security posture for service teams.
	* Empowered SecEng with visibility and approvals.
		* Growth: Expanded user base (new customer).
	* Improved relationships with customers enabling being able to suggest features rather than waiting for requirements.
	* Gave visibility to management (and broader company) through Datadog dashboards to see in vs out of compliance per account.
	* External customers data was now more secure, even though they would not know.

## Ownership

> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

* **Situation**: Needed to spin up a test environment to develop the build of a new server type. The provisioning system for physical infra was owned by another team. The documentation was very verbose without a clear starting point.
* **Task**: As an engineer for the OpenStack tiger team, we needed automated builds of the infra.
* **Action**:  Wrote and created a PR for a quickstart guide.
* **Result**: Better documentation for another team. Also, empowered new engineers to quickly get started with a testing environment.

## Invent and Simplify

> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

* **Action**: Introduced con
* **Result**: Fast to provision infra. homogeneous base for all clients.

## Are Right, A Lot

* **Situation**: The team was moving forward with a solution that did not sit well with me from a security perspective. The rational was it is better then what we have and it can be complete in the short expected delivery date.

## Learn and Be Curious

> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

## Hire and Develop the Best

> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

## Insist on the Highest Standards

> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

* **Result**: 

Proper implementation of secret propagation. I was not satisfied with the proposed solution. Across the next few days I researched and designed a solution that was more secure and less technical debt.

## Think Big

> Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

## Bias for Action

Cleaning up unused resources across all accounts.

## Frugality

* **Situation**: 
* **Task**: 
* **Action**:  
* **Result**: 

Converting data entry systems from EOL Windows and MS Office machines to running open source software that was receiving security updates.

## Earn Trust

> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Putting myself out there by doing demo/presentations for the team when I was new. This encouraged more junior engineers to try. I provided accolades during our weekly retrospectives for the effort made and information shared.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Advocating for a colleague to be promoted and move to automation team. I disagreed with the assessment that the team the engineer was could not afford to lose him. I felt it was unfair to engineer and that the company was risking loosing him all together. The next quarter he was the first promotion to a newly formed engineering team.

Disagreed with the design decision of secret propagation. While is was an improvement, it involved moving private keys and that did not sit well with me. I was the minority opinion so work began on the less than idea solution. Over the next few days I researched and designed an improved solution. I reached outed to a couple engineers for peer review and, in the process, gained their support. Then I presented the solution the team as a whole, illustrating a roadmap that would leverage the work that was in flight and a timeline that did not change our delivery date.

* **Situation**: The team was moving forward with a solution that did not sit well with me from a security perspective. The rational was it is better then what we have and it can be complete in the short expected delivery date.
