## [Mind the platform execution gap](https://martinfowler.com/articles/platform-prerequisites.html)  
* _The platform team needs to think of the platform as a software product, needing dialog with its users, attention to reliable operations, and a healthy team environment._
* employees spend their time on value-adding activities ...  
  * One way to achieve this is to use SaaS to outsource functionality that isn’t part of their organisation’s core business.  
  * Another way is to consolidate infrastructure capabilities required by many teams and services into a digital platform  
* The purpose of a developer productivity platform is to allow teams who build end-user products concentrate on their core mission.
* Software engineering excellence
  Build small, simple pieces that you can change independently
  as defined by Kief Morris in his book Infrastructure as Code
* Healthy Teams
  * systems for planning work need to be mature.
     must have backlogs of items described in terms of their value and have processes for prioritisation,


XP
* The difference between a team and a group of individuals are the existence of a common set of goals and values (the XP values are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect) as well as the presence of a high bandwidth, low latency medium that they use to communicate (Sit Together).
* ensure that information about the status of the work is visible at all times, which includes both progress on planned features and observability on running systems (Informative Workspace).
