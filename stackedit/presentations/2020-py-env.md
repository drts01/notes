# Python Environment

## Abstract
When working with Python, have things stopped working as expected? The system's Python gets hosed? Dependency versions are inconsistent between environments? It does not have to be like this, there is a better way.

We will go over managing multiple versions of Python and isolating packages with virtual environments. Also, we will cover a few tools and a workflow that will help you keep your sanity when working with Python.

This talk applies to both developers and system engineers.
