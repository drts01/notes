# Dev in Ops

## Titles

* The Dev in Ops Transition / Transformation
* You Got Dev In My Ops

## Abstract

Not much develop actually occurs in devops. We pretend that giving the operation team new responsibilities such as maintaining a Jenkins box or migration Bash scripts to YAML for configuration management is dev work.

If we want to truly empower Operations and DevOps, true coding work must be integrated. A path to the promise land can be walked with Jupyter Notebooks

---
Development within operations teams is frequently is minimal if any. Many organization claim to being doing the DevOps. This may consist of updating YAML files with, at best, partial automation. Or it may be systems administrator of Jenkins nodes or a K8s cluster. The result is the continuation of manually driven playbooks and one-off tasks with very little opportunity to foster coding skills. This is a dangerous feedback loop that will prevent an operations team from growing in ability and efficiently.

A bridge to transition an operation team to an development team for infrastructure  is to provide an opportunity to 

small, incremental, digestible bits of code at a time

Produce shareable, repeatable, auditable (peer-review) playbooks. As the operation team becomes more comfortable writing code, they will want to solve more problems in this manner. Patterns will emerge and code will repeat among the Notebooks. Eventually, the team will want to develop their own library or tool (around a process). It will also behoove the stakeholder to encourage this as it will make the team more efficient and process consistent.

---

Many system administrators are being pressured into becoming developers. This is a major leap for tradition operation teams. This is a nontrivial ask while also continuing to keep the ship running with new services to maintain coming online all the time. A plan for success incorporates incremental coding opportunities.

Many devops teams function as operation teams for platforms, such as Jenkins or K8s. There may use of tool like Infrastructure-as-Code, i.e. updating YAML files. But this is not coding, and there is ample opportunity to do more. Because of this gap, there continues to be playbooks and manual intervention.

We will go over how Jupyter Notebooks can help transition sysadmins, and gain incremental coding opportunities. 
Notebooks provide an opportunity to write small bits of code, lowering any intimidation to coding.

Rather than trying to script something in all BASH or Python, it can be mixed.

Visualize data, variables, along the way.

Share playbooks/process

Provide examples to supplent documentation

We live in an era of DevOps, but the reality is that minimal development is happening in operations. There are growing pressures for operation teams to do more coding. Reason include, repeatably, constancy, scale, gathering and making sense of infrastructure data, efficiently, and speed.

Even teams with the DevOps title are not doing development work. They may be responsible for maintain Jenkins nodes, build pipelines, and updating YAML files for infrastructure changes. But this is not development work.

Any gaps in the DevOps tools, lead to manual intervention, playbooks.

With such a large opertunity to imporve

Everyday more teams and organizations are moving toward doing the DevOps. This usually includes leveraging Infrastructure-as-Code, build pipelines, containerization, etc. (Ansible/Saltstack, Jenkins/Gitlab, Docker/K8s). But there is not much actually coding.

Because of the lack of development in these team, manual intervention and playbooks persist to fill the gaps of the tool. This results in inconsistencies and impedes the ability to scale.

But to ask team to switch to a development focus is a nontrivial request. Especially as they attempt to maintain the existing infrastructure and continue to on-board new services being deployed. But there is a more incremental and less daunting approach than leaping into a new paradigm.

Jupyter Notebooks can be used to help non-development teams make the transition to writing more code as part of their normal process. With Jupyter, small bits of code can be written, executed, and introspected, thus making learning to write code less daunting.
Further more Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to initally codify a task into a repeatable, shareable, auditable, and versionable playbook. Notebooks can also server as supplemental examples to documentation.

Any data collected during the execution of the Notebook can easily be visualized. This can empower engineers to make sense of a metric that is not currently being feed into an ELK cluster, Graphana, or Permethious.

Eventually patterns will emerge from these notebooks. Then code can be extracted in to their own library or tool. Now the team is starting to look more like a development team. The data from previously executed Notebooks can also serve as test data for the team's new product and services.

With the ability to develop, operation teams can gather and make sense of infrastructure data, increase speed, improve reliability, and find optimizations.

We live in an era of DevOps, but the reality is that minimal development is happening in operations. Opportunities to improve efficiency and reliability are being missed. There is a push to change this in many organizations. But, operations teams do not receive addition bandwidth to make this transition. To empower these teams, plan to introduce small chunks of coding to the existing workload. Jupyter Notebooks can facilitate this and the adoption of development in operations.

System administrators and operation leads will learn how to leverage Jupyter Notebooks for fun and profit.

Every day more teams and organizations are attempting to do the DevOps. This includes leveraging Infrastructure-as-Code (Ansible/Saltstack), build pipelines (Jenkins/Gitlab), containerization (Docker/K8s), etc. But, there is no significant development work occurring.

Many organizations are asking operation teams to shift towards a development focus. There are good reasons for this including reliably and the ability to scale. But this is a nontrivial request. Existing workloads and responsibilities are not offloaded. Little bandwidth is available for transforming a team. 

The lack of development within these teams leads to manual playbooks and intervention to fill the gaps in their tools. This is inefficient and error-prone. The result is a negative feedback loop, preventing fostering coding skills. But, there is a more gradual, less disruptive approach to embrace coding.

Jupyter Notebooks are not only for data scientists. Non-development teams can leverage Notebooks to incrementally write more code. With Jupyter, small bits of code can be written, executed, and introspected. This makes learning to write code less daunting.

Furthermore, Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to initially codify a task. They are shareable, repeatable, auditable, and versionable playbook. Notebooks can also server as supplemental examples to documentation.

Patterns will emerge from the notebooks. Code can then be extracted into their own library or tool. Previously executed Notebooks can provide test-cases and test-data. Now the team is on the path to success and a culture of development practices.

With the ability to develop, the effectiveness of the team increases. Now the focus the team can shift towards preventive and optimization work.

Any team that desires to leverage code to create solutions will benefit from this talk. While many examples will center around System Administrators, the patterns presented are applicable to Information Security, Compliance, NOC, etc.
