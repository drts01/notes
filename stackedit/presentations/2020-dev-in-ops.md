# Dev in Ops

Not much develop actually occurs in devops. We pretend that giving the operation team new responsibilities such as maintaining a Jenkins box or migration Bash scripts to YAML for configuration management is dev work.

If we want to truly empower Operations and DevOps, true coding work must be integrated. A path to the promise land can be walked with Jupyter Notebooks

Many systems engineers
