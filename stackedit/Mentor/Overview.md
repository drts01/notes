# Community Guidelines

This document is to foster a common understanding of purpose and expectiation.

We believe in positive language and encourage "do's" over "do not's".

This is a living document and is subject to evolve with the community.

## Tenets

 1. Be Curious; Have fun.
 2. Help each other grow.
 3. Pay it forward.

### Be Curious; Have Fun
This is not school. We are here to full our curiosity and have a good time.

### Help Each Other Grow
i.e.:
 - Answering questions from other members
 - Asking questions in public channels
 - Share projects
 - Encourage each other

Notes:
 - If we are encouraging one another we are are not bulling, shaming, excluding, etc.
 - It is okay for use to embrace our differences and celebrate them. Sharing culture, heritage, experiances, ideas, etc is how we grow.

### Pay It Forward

 - Helping new members feel welcomed.
 - Sharing knowledge and participating beyond our group.

## Conflict Resolution
Misunderstandings, culture clashes, poor choices of words, etc happen.

### Guidelines
 - Everyone one is entitled to their perspectives
 - Everyone is responsible for the their own feelings
 - Everyone is accountable for their actions.
 - Actions disruptive to the community need to be addressed.

 1. We start from the premise that harm was not intended.
 2. We provide an opportunity for parties to understand how they affect one another, with a facilitator.
	 - Allow parties to express their feelings free of judgement.
 3. We encourage parties to reach their own resolution. If that appears unlikely, the mediator will make a decision on the best path forward.
 3. If no satisfactory resolution can be reached, we may need to part ways (tempararely or permentatly)
     It is okay that we are not all be compatible everyone. We encourage everyone to find communities where they can thrive.
