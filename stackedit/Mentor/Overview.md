# Tenets

 1. Be Curious; Have fun.
 2. Help each other grow.
 3. Pay it forward.

Notes:
We believe in positive languge. 

## Be Curious; Have Fun
This is not school. We are here to full our curiosity and have a good time.

## Help Each Other Grow
i.e.:
 - Answering questions from other members
 - Asking questions in public changelles
 - Share projects
 - Encourage each other

Notes:
 - If we are encouraging one another we are are not bulling, shaming, excluding, etc.
 - It is okay for use to embracess our differences and celebrate them. Sharing culture, heritage, experiances, ideas, etc is how we grow.

## Pay It Forward

 - Sharing knowledge out side our community.
