Notes:
We believe in positive languge and encourage "do's" over "do not's".

## Tenets

 1. Be Curious; Have fun.
 2. Help each other grow.
 3. Pay it forward.

### Be Curious; Have Fun
This is not school. We are here to full our curiosity and have a good time.

### Help Each Other Grow
i.e.:
 - Answering questions from other members
 - Asking questions in public changelles
 - Share projects
 - Encourage each other

Notes:
 - If we are encouraging one another we are are not bulling, shaming, excluding, etc.
 - It is okay for use to embracess our differences and celebrate them. Sharing culture, heritage, experiances, ideas, etc is how we grow.

### Pay It Forward

 - Sharing knowledge out side our community.

## Conflict Resolution
Misunderstandings, culture clashes, etc happen.

 1. We start from the premism that harm was not intended.
 2. We provide an opperunity for individuals to redeam themselves.
 3. If no satifactory resolution can be reached, we may need to part ways (tempararely or permentatly)
