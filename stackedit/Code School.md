# Introduction

## Why learn to code?

## What is CS?

# Mission

## Objectives
* build self-confidence through doing
* build a sense of community though collaboration
* teach computational thinking
* Promote open-source tools, development, and the community

# Metrics
## Success / Goals
* Demonstrate competency in basic/fundamental CS concepts
* Contribute/Publish a coding CV (i.e. Github repos, website, etc)
* Can articulate how coding can be applied to interests outside of "tech".
* Participation outside of meeting/class/session (user-groups, conferences, contributing to open source projects, etc)

# Requirements
## Student / Participant
* Access to Internet
* Ability to participate in a once a week meeting
* Equipment TBD
   Tablet, Chromebook, Laptop

## Mentor / Facilitator
* 4 hours / week
	* 2 hour class/session per week
	* 2 additional hours to:
		* participate/promote community/communications outside of meeting (responding to comments in chat, answering emails, etc)
		* prepping for next session
		* supporting other facilitators

## Internal
* Continued interest in CS, i.e.:
   Purse CS related career, degree, hobbies, or join user groups and/or trade organizations
* Re-enrollment
