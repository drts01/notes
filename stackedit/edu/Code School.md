# Introduction

## Why learn to code?
Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age, and it is important to understand and be able to work with and understand the technology. Coding helps with communication, creativity, math,writing, and confidence.

> "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think. It's like going to law school. I don't think anybody should be a _lawyer_, but going to law school can actually be useful because it teaches you how to think in a certain way....I view computer science as a liberal art." --Steve Jobs, https://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-quotes-from-the-lost-steve-jobs-interview-showing-this-weekend-2011-11

### What is code?
Code is a written set of instructions that tells the computer what to do.

### What is CS?
Computer science is the study of computation and information.

Computer science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and applications. It addresses both human-made and natural information processes, such as communication, control, perception, learning and intelligence.

>The fundamental question underlying all of computing is, What can be(efficiently) automated? --Peter J. Denning, Encyclopedia of Computer Science (2000 ed)

>The study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their impact on society. -- ACM, 2006

# Mission

## Objectives
* build self-confidence through doing
* build a sense of community though collaboration
* teach computational thinking
* Promote open-source tools, development, and the community

# Metrics
## Success / Goals
* Demonstrate competency in basic/fundamental CS concepts
* Contribute/Publish a coding CV (i.e. Github repos, website, etc)
* Can articulate how coding can be applied to interests outside of "tech".
* Participation outside of meeting/class/session (user-groups, conferences, contributing to open source projects, etc)

# Requirements
## Student / Participant
* Access to Internet
* Ability to participate in a once a week meeting
* Equipment TBD
   Tablet, Chromebook, Laptop

## Mentor / Facilitator
* 4 hours / week
	* 2 hour class/session per week
	* 2 additional hours to:
		* participate/promote community/communications outside of meeting (responding to comments in chat, answering emails, etc)
		* prepping for next session
		* supporting other facilitators

## Internal
* Continued interest in CS, i.e.:
   Purse CS related career, degree, hobbies, or join user groups and/or trade organizations
* Re-enrollment

# Possible Future Tangential Classes
"Coding" can be the gateway drug to additional concepts in tech/computing.

* Computer Basics
	* Hardware
	* Operating System (Linux/Unix)
	* Networking
	* History
* Embedded Systems
	* BBC Micro.bit
	* Arduino
	* Lego Mindstorm
	* Circuit Playground
* Electronics Basics
	* Solid State
		* LEDs, Transistors, capacitors, etc
		* read schematics
		* ohms law
	* Digital
		* Logic gates
		* How computers work (NAND gates)
		* Integrated circuits
* Python Programing
	* APIs
	* Design Patterns
	* Functional Programing
	* Create libraries and cli tools

# Questions
* Intake, where/how will we bring kids in?

# Suggestions
* Leverage GWC
   Pros
		* Their model is not a full class
		* They have additional resources (as listed abobe)
		* Have pre-made lessons
	* Cons
		* We need to seek approval to join ASAP as they follow the school year for access. Traditional a "host site" is needed. Not sure if we are "virtual" or nomadic.
