 - What was the problem?
 - How did you check/validate your code/service? (test, build automation, debug)
 - How did you get input/feedback from the team? (code review)
 - Did you get stuck at any point? How did you get unstuck? (looking up info before asking for help)
 - How did you document your work? (code comments, readme, wiki)
 - How did you deploy?
 - What would you do differently or what could be improved?

## DevOps

 - Why DevOps?
	 - What are the stages/loop?
	 - Key components, i.e. SCM, build server, etc
	 - Continuous Integration, Delivery, vs Deployment
	 - Feedback
	 - Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing (CAMS)
 - What are common DevOps tools?
 - Why/When to automate?
	 - repreated process
	 - error prone process
	 - engineer engament time
	 - "low moral" work (things people dont want to do)
	 - not: one-off (maybe), focusing on phasing out the process
 - Types of tests?

## Development

### Git
 - How to to ensure you have the most recent code locally? (fetch or pull)
 - What is a branch or tag?
 - How to know
### HTTP/ReSTful

- What is a ReSTful API?
- What is HTTP?
- (HTTP verbs) How would you query an endpoint?
- (HTTP verbs) How would you upload data?
- (HTTP status codes) Familiar with common codes?
- (Auth / Sec) How to query endpoint safely?
	- always over TLS
	- Auth headers

## Ops

Linux and Cloud

 - Have you manged a fleet or cluster of servers?
	 - SSH + scripts
	 - Config Managment
 - What are Linux container?
 - Walk through an example of troubleshooting a service

## Soft

 - Any current personal projects?
 - Fave technical podcasts or books?
 - Attend user groups and/or conferences? DevOpsDays
