## InfoSec

### Team / Subboradenats

 - What is the typical type of work/day look like?
 - How is work being prioritized? (how is risk being assessed?
 - What is your biggest goal/desire for the team to achieve?
 - What gets in your way of that goal?
 - What tasks consume all of your time?
 - Which tasks do you dislike the most?
 - How can a manager help you?
 - What do you want from a manager?
 - Any particular reasons you are not appling for the role?

### My perspectives

 - Provide InfoSec as product/service
 - ShiftLeft - Attack DevSecOps at the CI Pipeline
	 - Work w/ product teams as a partner
		 - provide tooling/feedback on mitigating vulns, i.e. dep updates
		 - standarized build tool chains
			 - simpler to intergrate and audit
			 - less work for teams as they do not design their build process
			 - one less hurdle when engineers move between teams
